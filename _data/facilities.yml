intro: "The scientific programme plans to show the participants a wide spectrum of high profile scientific and academic facilities present in Pisa and Florence:
<br>
  - The VIRGO site of the European Gravitational Observatory (EGO)
<br>
  - The Italian National Research Council (CNR)
<br>
  - The National Institute for Nuclear Physics (INFN)
<br>
  - The European Laboratory for Non-linear Spectroscopy (LENS)
<br>
  - The University of Pisa
<br>
  - The University of Florence
<br>
  - The Sant’Anna School of Advanced Studies in Pisa
<br>
  - The Galileo Museum in Florence
<br>
<br>
Besides the visits, there will be a large number of talks, just like in previous editions. In particular, we will have overviews of all the major topics and experiments currently running in the aforementioned facilities and their implications. This will allow us to appreciate the visits better and understand the concepts from different perspectives. It will undoubtedly be a rich experience."
