  title: "Ultra-strong THz light-matter coupling, THz quantum cascade laser frequency combs, and THz superconducting metamaterials"
  bio: "Giacomo Scalari has been an Associate Professor at ETH Zurich since April 2020. He obtained his degree in physics from the University of Pisa in 1999. After a period at the Scuola Superiore S. Anna in Pisa, he completed his Ph.D. in December 2005 with a thesis on magneto-spectroscopy and the development of THz quantum cascade lasers. He moved to ETH Zurich in 2007 and became a permanent senior scientist in Prof. J. Faist's group in 2011. His research interests are in the field of ultra-strong THz light-matter coupling, THz quantum cascade laser frequency combs, and THz superconducting metamaterials. He received the national award from the Swiss Physical Society in 2006 for applied physics and an ERC Consolidator Grant for THz quantum cascade laser frequency combs in 2016."

  title: "Multimessenger investigation of neutron stars and pulsars using high-energy photons. Gravitational waves, machine learning and neural networks"
  bio: "Massimiliano Razzano is a researcher at the Department of Physics of the University of Pisa. His research focuses on the multimessenger investigation of the most extreme cosmic phenomena, such as neutron stars and pulsars, using high-energy photons (X-rays and gamma rays) and gravitational waves. He is a member of the Fermi Large Area Telescope, Virgo, and Einstein Telescope scientific collaborations. He is also interested in advanced data analysis techniques, including machine learning and neural networks, applied to complex problems in modern physics, often involving citizen science. His recent publications include studies on the joint analysis of gravitational wave candidates, pulsar analysis with Fermi-LAT, and deep learning applications for gravitational wave detection. At the University of Pisa, Razzano teaches courses such as Observational Astrophysics, Physics of Gravitational Waves, Physics 1, and Multimessenger Physics Laboratory."

  title: ""
  bio: "Andrea Macchi, from the Department of Physics of the University of Pisa, is a resercher in the CNR-INO specialized in the interaction of high-intensity lasers with matter and physics of plasmas. His research focuses on exploring how these powerful lasers behave when they hit different materials and how these interactions can accelerate tiny particles to very high speeds. This research has applications in many fields, including fundamental physics, astrophysics, and medical technology, where it can be used to develop new ways to treat diseases. At the University of Pisa, he shares his knowledge by teaching courses on these fascinating topics."

  title: "High-power fiber components for gravitational wave detector"
  bio: "Matthieu Gosselin is a French researcher at the European Gravitational Observatory, which hosts the Virgo gravitational wave detector. In 2014, he obtained a master's degree in telecommunications engineering and a research master's in photonics. He then completed a PhD in experimental physics at the University of Pisa in 2018 as part of the GraWIToN project (Marie Curie Program), focusing on the development of high-power optical components. He currently leads the optics group at the European Gravitational Observatory and serves as the system manager for the Advanced Virgo+ Injection subsystem. His work focuses on designing and commissioning Virgo's injection system, as well as developing and optimizing input-output optics for present and future gravitational wave detectors."

  bio: "Following her graduation from the Liceo Classico Galileo Galilei in Pisa, Julia earned a Bachelor's degree in Physics from the University of Pisa, and is now pursuing a Master's degree at the same institution focused on data analysis and experimental physics, with a strong interest in the interfaces between Particle Physics and Astrophysics. Her biggest interests include multi-messenger physics and astrophysical data analysis. Julia is also enthusiastic about science communication, and sharing scientific knowledge through public talks and visual presentations. Her commitment to science extends to her role as an official guide at the Advanced Virgo site, where she explains gravitational wave research to the public. In her free time, Julia can be found working in local theater productions."
