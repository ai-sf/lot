  The Lights of Tuscany programme has reached its sixth edition and we are happy to annouce the return of this event on the international scale, with new activities and improvements. 
  The event will have a focus on Photonics, but a number of other topics will be touched upon, including Matter Physics, Quantum Optics, Biophysics, and Cultural Heritage Physics.
  Having a basic understanding of these topics is certainly helpful to enjoy this event to the fullest, but don't worry! LOT25 is a learning opportunity open to everyone, regardless of their academical background!
  </p><p>
  LOT25 will also see alongside its participants, <b>some students from the last years of high school</b> in Pisa who will join us on the first day of conferences and during the visit in EGO-VIRGO. This initiative is made to give them a first look in the world of research and university! They will have as well the chance to meet both students and professors and ask them any question regarding their research. Anyone is invited to share their own experience during the conferences and coffee breaks.
