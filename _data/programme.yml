  The Lights of Tuscany programme has reached its sixth edition and we are happy to annouce the return of this event on the international scale, with new activities and improvements. 
  The event will have a focus on Photonics, but a number of other topics will be touched upon, including Matter Physics, Quantum Optics, Biophysics, and Cultural Heritage Physics.
  Having a basic understanding of these topics is certainly helpful to enjoy this event to the fullest, but don't worry! LOT25 is a learning opportunity open to everyone, regardless of their academical background!

  Lights of Tuscany 2025 will give you a glimpse into the world of research and the chance to meet both reserchers and professors and ask them any question regarding their activities. Anyone is invited to share their own experience during the seminars and coffee breaks.
