  title: "Ultra-strong THz light-matter coupling, THz quantum cascade laser frequency combs, and THz superconducting metamaterials"
  bio: "Giacomo Scalari has been an Associate Professor at ETH Zurich since April 2020. He obtained his degree in physics from the University of Pisa in 1999. After a period at the Scuola Superiore S. Anna in Pisa, he completed his Ph.D. in December 2005 with a thesis on magneto-spectroscopy and the development of THz quantum cascade lasers. He moved to ETH Zurich in 2007 and became a permanent senior scientist in Prof. J. Faist's group in 2011. His research interests are in the field of ultra-strong THz light-matter coupling, THz quantum cascade laser frequency combs, and THz superconducting metamaterials. He received the national award from the Swiss Physical Society in 2006 for applied physics and an ERC Consolidator Grant for THz quantum cascade laser frequency combs in 2016."

  title: "Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics. Quantum control of matter through light-matter interactions."
  bio: "Donatella Ciampini is a researcher at the University of Pisa's Department of Physics. Her work focuses on Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics, particularly on the quantum control of matter through light-matter interactions. In recent years, she has also expanded her research into applied physics, leveraging her expertise in cold atom studies. She has contributed to projects like GINGER, which explores fundamental physics using high-sensitivity ring laser gyroscopes. Her recent publications include works on optomechanical coupling, ring laser gyroscopes, and thermometry optimization, highlighting her broad research interests. At the University of Pisa, she teaches courses such as Physics 2, Fundamentals of Radiation-Matter Interaction, Fundamentals of Optics, Atomic Optics, and Structure of Matter."

  title: "Multimessenger investigation of neutron stars and pulsars using high-energy photons. Gravitational waves, machine learning and neural networks"
  bio: "Massimiliano Razzano is a researcher at the Department of Physics of the University of Pisa. His research focuses on the multimessenger investigation of the most extreme cosmic phenomena, such as neutron stars and pulsars, using high-energy photons (X-rays and gamma rays) and gravitational waves. He is a member of the Fermi Large Area Telescope, Virgo, and Einstein Telescope scientific collaborations. He is also interested in advanced data analysis techniques, including machine learning and neural networks, applied to complex problems in modern physics, often involving citizen science. His recent publications include studies on the joint analysis of gravitational wave candidates, pulsar analysis with Fermi-LAT, and deep learning applications for gravitational wave detection. At the University of Pisa, Razzano teaches courses such as Observational Astrophysics, Physics of Gravitational Waves, Physics 1, and Multimessenger Physics Laboratory."
